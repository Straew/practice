/*
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
$$ 3  10  5  16  8 4  2 1$$
Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.
Input
The only input line contains an integer n.
Output
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.
Constraints

1<= n < = 10^6

Example
Input:
3

Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
